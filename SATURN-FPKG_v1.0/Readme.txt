SATURN-FPKG v1.0 by Jabu

Just like ps2-fpkg and psx-fpkg, 
this app lets you convert your Sega Saturn games(in cue/bin format) into PS4 fPKGs.


How to use it?
1. Run SATURN-FPKG.exe
2. Select a CUE file of your Saturn game in "Disc"
3. Customize some settings(you can change the icon, ram cartridge, game title etc)
4. Innput a unique NP Title(auto game id detection coming soon!) or press the "Random NP Title" button
5. Click "Create fPKG" and choose a storage location
6. Install the created fPKG on your PS4 and play


Notes:
-Make sure you use a unique NP Title, otherwise you may overwrite some other game you already created!
-You can select which RAM cartridge should be used for a game(eg Street Fighter Zero 3 uses the 4MB cart for better animations)
and you can also hide the in-game "Press Options for Options" box by checking the "Hide Options Box" checkbox.
-When playing a game press the touchpad or hold the Options button for a settings menu,
you can change some display options and button configs there, you can also quick save/load/rewind the game there.


Known Issues:
-Works only on fw 9.00, backporting needs be done to older fw's
If anyone backports this emulator to older fw's please let me know, I'll include them in an update.
-Some games may crash when saving a state(Street Fighter Zero 3 does this), idk why yet.
